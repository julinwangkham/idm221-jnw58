## About
### Hello!
My name is Julin Wangkham, and I love to work in both 3D and 2D mediums. I am currently a student pursuing my bachelorâ€™s degree in Animation and Visual Effects. I have always been passionate about my creative endeavors and hoped to someday work alongside others in creating an animated feature film. I was interested in how those who work in the animation and film industry can create such breathtaking and inspirational movies- with each step being intricate and thoughtful in detail. My passions of movie watching and drawing drew me to pursue animation as a career.
