    <h1>
        Hello!
    </h1>
    <p>
        My name is Julin Wangkham, and I love to work in both 3D and 2D mediums.
        I am currently a student pursuing my bachelorâ€™s degree in Animation and Visual Effects.
        I have always been passionate about my creative endeavors and hoped to someday work alongside others in creating an animated feature film. 
        I was interested in how those who work in the animation and film industry can create such breathtaking and inspirational movies- with each step being intricate and thoughtful in detail. 
        My passions of movie watching and drawing drew me to pursue animation as a career.
